Hi! I am __Leonardo__. I build software since 2008.

[Here you can find some apps I have developed](/apps), in fields such as mHealth, Telecommunications and B2B. I am from Cali, Colombia, love to learn, work remotely and co-organize the [CaliSharp](https://www.meetup.com/CaliSharpCO/) meetup. Here is my [Blog](https://blog.lvbernal.com/) (in spanish) and my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lvbernal/). You can find me as lvbernal almost everywhere online.

If you want to contact me, send me a message via LinkedIn or Twitter.
