Hi! I am __Leonardo Vargas__, I love software development, telecommunications and research. I'm a __mobile applications developer__ since 2008, and in that journey, I have worked with __Xamarin__, Android, __Python__ (Django, Spark, GNU Radio), __.NET__, JavaScript (React, Redux, Angular) and __Cloud Computing__ platforms (AWS, Azure).

[Here you can find some apps I have developed](/apps), in fields such as mHealth, Telecommunications, B2B and Environment.

I am from Cali, Colombia, love to learn, __work remotely__ and co-organize the [Xamarin Cali Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Xamarin-Cali/). Here is my [Blog](https://blog.lvbernal.com/) (mainly in spanish) and my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lvbernal/). You can find me as @lvbernal [almost] everywhere online.
